# What is Participle

- It's a form of a verb that is either `ing` or `past participle`.
- A participle clause is a subordinate clause which begins with a participle.
- The participle verbs are to show things like **event order**, **time**, **cause and effect**
  - `Stepping on camera, I relaxed completely.` (When I stepped on camera.)
  - `Fried in lemon, the fish would taste delicious.` (If the fish were fried in lemon.)

# Usage

## The Participle Verbs Do Not Change The Tense

## Participle Clauses Can Have Its Own Subject Or Tense

## Participle Clauses Often Have Implied Subjects

Do not make a participle clause with a confusing subject
  - `Seeing it fall, the tree hit me in the back.`
    - the subject could imply `the tree saw it fall.`
    - It's better to say `As I saw it fall, the tree hit me in the back.`
  - `Feeling weak, the boy attacked man.` 
    - the subject could imply `the man` or `the boy`
    - It's better to say `While the man is feeling weak, the boy attacked the man.`
