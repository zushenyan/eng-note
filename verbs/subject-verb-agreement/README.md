# When Singular And Plural Are The Same

Nouns that are both singular and plural have different meanings when using a singular (`does/has/am/is`) or a plural (`do/have/are`) verb.

For example, `economics`, `headquarters`, `series` and `fish`.

- Sheep
  - `The sheep is herded by the sheepdog into the farmer's van.` (it)
  - `The sheep are herded by the sheepdog into the farmer's van.` (they)
- Politics
  - `Their country's politics are a mystery to me.` (their opinion)
  - `Politics is a mystery to me.` (the subject)
- Government
  - `The government is debating the new law.` (it)
  - `The government are debating the new law.` (they)
- The whole family
  - `The whole family is a great bun of people` (it)
  - `The whole family are a great bun of people` (they)
- The team
  - `The team doesn't have any worthy opponents.` (it)
  - `The team don't have any worthy opponents.` (they)

In a relative clause, we use `which` for the group and `who` for the unit
- `The government, who are in talks now, are reviewing the law.`
- `The government, which is in talks now, is reviewing the law.`

# Nouns With No Plural

Some nouns that always end with `s` should be used with singular verb. For example, `mathematics`, `gymnastics`, `physics`, `games`, `measles`, `dominos`...

- `The news about the king's death *has* been reported around the world.` (it)
- `Mathematics is a hard subject.` (it)

# Nouns With No Singular

Some nouns are collective, which means they represent a group. They should be always used with plural verbs.

- `Congratulations are due to you on your birthday.`
- `Fishes are swimming in the river.`
- `My jeans don't fit anymore.`
- `Are my glasses in the kitchen?`
- `Tights were fashionable.`

> the + adj

In English, we use this to create a group noun.

- `The police are coming.`
- `The British are coming.`
- `The staff are unhappy with the wage cut.`
- `The rich have the most to lose.`
- `The sick have suffered enough.`

# Qunaities, Amounts, Portions, Mathematics

- Counting the number of individual
  - `There *are* 60 minutes in an hour.`
- Judging the unit of time
  - `60 minutes *is* perfect for me to get across town in that.`
- `One` should always be followed with singular verb
  - `One of my friends has a car.`
  - `More than one of us has a car.`
- `of`
  - `Half of the cake was eaten.` (...of it...)
  - `Half of the cakes were eaten.` (...of them...)
- In mathematics, the verb can be singular or plural. It depends on the phrasing.
  - `Two and three is/are five.` (it/they)
  - `Two plus three is five.` (it)
  - `Two times three is fifteen.` (it)
  - `Two threes are fifteen.` (they)

# And, Or, Neither, Nor,

- and
  - `The King and Queen are coming.` (they)
  - `Fish and chips is my favorite meal.` (it, because it is a name.)
  - `The new CEO and majority shareholder is coming.` (one person)
  - `The new CEO and majority shareholder are coming.` (two people)
- or
  - `A pizza or a curry is being delivered.`
  - `A pizza or 3 curries are being delivered.`
  - `3 pizzas or a curry is being delivered.`
  - `Either the cat or the dog goes.`
  - `Either the cat or the dogs go.`
  - `Neither I nor my family has stolen anything.`
  - `Neither my family nor I have stolen anything.`

# Separated Subjects And Verbs

This happens due to a prepositional phrase which is used to describe a noun.

Simply ignore all the prepositional phrases and focus on the subject.

- `This bunch of bananas is ripe.`
- `These bunches of bananas are ripe.`
- `The house down the lane is very cheap.`
- `The housees down the lane are very cheap.`
- `The attitude of the people has remained unchanged.`
- `The attitudes of the people have remained unchanged.`

# Singular Or Plural Verb With a Cleft Sentence

Usually, it's used with singular verb, but in some cases, cleft sentences use large subjects and long complements.

Because the verb can either agree woth the subject or the complement - which means, in the case of a plural complement - the verb is plural.

- `*What makes me angry is* people who throw rubbish on the ground.` (verb agrees with subject)
- `*What makes me angry* are people who throw rubbish on the ground.` (verb agrees with plural complement)
- `*The most interesting thing I saw was* the elephant at the theatre.` (verb agrees with subject)
- `*The most interesting thing I saw* were the elephants at the theatre.` (verb agrees with plural complement)
