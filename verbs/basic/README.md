  - Cannot be a passive.
    - `I arrive.`

# Reporting Verbs

![reported-verbs](reported-verbs.png)

`*` in formal writing, verbs followed by `(that) + clause` use `infinitive` instead of `present` tense. Mostly it doesn't make ant differnce. Just a note here, don't worry about it.

- `I advise that he go to bed early` (normally `goes`)


# Stative (Static) vs Dynamic Verbs

## Stative (Static) Verbs
