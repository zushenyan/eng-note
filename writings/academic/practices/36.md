The line graph below illustrates the number of oversea residents visiting Australia, and the table depicts the number of visitors grouped by country from 1975 to 2005.

Overall, we can see that the total number of visitors rose steadily over the 20 years, from 10 million in 1975 to just above 30 million in 2005. It was a sign of Australia becoming a tourist attraction to travellers from all over the world.

Moving on to the statistic table, we can have a clearer picture of the view in terms of the traveller's constitution by country. The top three countries that had significant growth in visiting were South Korea, Japan and Europe, with 7.1 million, 8.8 million and 3.4 million increase in 2005, respectively. For countries that we didn't bring up previously, for example, the USA, the figures for those nations' tourists had also risen marginally, roughly 3 million more than the visitors in total in 1975 combined with those countries.
