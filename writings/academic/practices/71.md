Since the advent of nuclear technology, we have been living with the help of this scientific breakthrough. Nevertheless, the danger of nuclear is also known to people. It can be either a bomb to destroy lives or an energy source to support our daily life. In my opinion, technology is a double-edged sword. It could be a threat while carrying out peaceful purposes.

The most well-known purpose of nuclear technology is the power generator. This kind of power is crucial for many industrialised countries and developing nations. However, incidents like radiation leaking pose a substantial danger to lands and the economy. Despite having precautions taken, there have been numerous disasters of radiation leaking happened in Russia and Japan.

Another use of this science is its medical use. Treatments for cancers involve using nuclear technology. Radiation can be applied to the human body to cure cancerous cells. Yet, this is a dangerous procedure. The application procedure could be painful, and the treatment doesn't always result in success.

The most worrying usage of nuclear is for military purposes. Even though nuclear weapons have been invented for many years and we haven't seen the whole planet gets destroyed, it is still not guaranteed that when wars between nations break out, the whole situation won't result in bombing each other, bringing the end of civilization.

To sum up, nuclear technology certainly has positive uses. However, it would have been better if it hadn't been used to create weapons if what we wished for was continuing to live.
