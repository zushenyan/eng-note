The bar chart compares the sales change in games software, DVD/video and CDs these three categories over the period of 2000 to 2003 around the globe. Overall, it can be seen that the CDs didn't change much, and in contrast, the sales of DVD/video grew nearly twice in 2003, however, though games software climbed slightly, it still wasn't comparable to the rest of the categories.

Between 2000 and 2003, the sales of CDs, which had kept sales for just over 30 billion dollars since 2000, remained barely changed, while DVD/video sold for just below $20 billion in 2000 and had risen significantly year by year, and in 2003, it had reached slightly higher than $30 billion, which was almost on a par with the sales of CDs.

On the other hand, the chart also indicates that the games software had grown slowly over those years. However, it didn't increase as considerably as DVD/video did. As we can see, it sold for approximately $15 billion in 2000, and in 2003, it had only reached just below $20 billion.
