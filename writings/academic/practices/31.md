The graph below demonstrates the fluctuation in the number of people at London underground station over the course of a day.

In the morning, the number of people increases rapidly, quadrupling from 100 to 400 after two hours at 6 am. After then, the figure falls significantly below 200 passengers at 10 am.

Starting from 11 am, the number of passengers rises slightly and plateaus between 250 and 300. At 2 pm, the number begins to plummet and hit a low of nearly 100 people at 4 pm. However, the flow of people starts to skyrocket once again and peaks at about 400 at 6 pm.

In the evening, a drastic decline appears and bottoms at about 125 people at 8 pm, with only a marginal growth at 9 pm, tailing off later.

In conclusion, the station is most crowded in the early morning and evening. On the contrary, the least crowded times are in the late afternoon and evening.
