The bar graph below shows changes in the fertility rate in six Gulf countries - Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman S.Arabia and the UAE between 1990 and 2000.

In 1990, we can see two striking countries having at least two births per woman more than the rest of the countries, which were Oman and S.Arabia, sitting at 7 and 6.7, respectively. However, in 2000, the figures for both countries dropped to 5.5.

Another example of countries with roughly the same birth rates was Qatar and the UAE. They started just more than 4 in 1990, but in 2000, the figures fell to 3.5 and 2.9, separately.

The third group of countries having the same pattern was Bahrain and Kuwait. Both were at 3.5 in 1990, but none avoided a decline and ended up at 2.5 and 2.7 in 2000, individually.

To sum up, there were decreases in birth rates in all six Gulf countries, but some encountered almost two times of decline in numbers compared to others.
