In 1910, a large of areas were occupied by industrial facilities, but in 1950, they had disappeared. In addition, in 1910, a railway ran through the neighbourhood, whereas in 1950, the railway had been removed. Furthermore, the townhouses which used to dominate in 1910 had been replaced by blocks of flats in 1950. As for the wastelands in 1910, they had been all assigned for other amenities in 1950.

Another major change to this area in 1950 was the demolition of houses on Sherman street made room for a spacious park with a children's play area. On the commercial side, the removal of townhouses and the railway made space for stores and a new street named New Lane in 1950. The original cafe and laundry were relocated to the upside of the stores.
