The following graph illustrates information about the people's age in Iceland between 1990 and 2020. With the help of visualized data, we can tell that the most significant change is in the 25-54 age group.

The 25-54 age group increased from 32% in 1990 to 49% in 2020 over the thirty years, with a 17% rise in total. Furthermore, the proportion of the 25-54 age group took almost half of the population in 2020. In contrast, the size of the 25-54 age group was only one-third of the population in 1990.

Another conspicuous change was the gradual drop in age groups 0-14 and 15-24. These two age groups - 0-14 and 15-24, started at 26% and 21% in 1990, finishing below 20% and 10% in 2020, respectively.

On the other hand, there wasn't a large change for the age group above 55. The size of 65 and over began at 13% in 1990, whereas it remained roughly the same in 2020. As for the figure of 55-64, it fell from 14% in 1990 to about 10% in 2020.
