The following two illustrations demonstrate spending patterns between 1966 and 1996 in the US.

In 1966, the largest category was foods which took up nearly half of the chart. The second largest group was cars. People tended to spend 23% of their income on purchasing cars.

Turn to the year 1996. Some figures indicate a few interesting trends. The food category had significantly decreased from 44% in 1966 to 14% in 1996. On the contrary, the money spent on cars boomed from 23% in 1966 to almost half of the chart in 1996. The cost of petrol and furniture had remained approximately the same since 1966. For categories restaurants and computers, one had doubled, and the other had grown ten times in 1996, respectively. Lastly, the expense of books, despite occupying 6% of the income in 1966, dropped to 1% in 1996.

Overall, we can conclude that the habit of spending had drastically changed over the period. Increased amounts spent on cars, computers, and eating out were made up for by drops in the cost of food and books.
