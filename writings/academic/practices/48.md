The diagram provides information about how a central heating system in a house works.

First of all, the cold water flows into the house through a tube from the roof. It will be stored in a water tank inside the top of the house through an overflow pipe. 

The boiler, which is fuelled by gas or oil, heats the water when it passes through it. Once the water has been heated, pipes will send the water to water radiators around the house. The water radiator has small tubes to help distribute the heat.

Cooled-down water used by radiators will be circulated back to the boiler through a pump or to the storage tank for re-heating. Some water is directed to the taps to provide hot water for the house.

Once the water has been through the radiators, it will return to the boiler to start another cycle for the central heating system.
