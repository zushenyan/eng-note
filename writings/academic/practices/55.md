The diagram illustrates how aluminium cans are recycled through a series of processes. According to this diagram, there are seven major steps involved.

In the beginning, instead of directly putting used cans in the disposal, these used cans can be put in special recycle bins. After this, recycling vendors will send trucks to collect these used bins and take them to a factory where used cans are sorted and cleaned. Followed by a series of additional processing, used cans are shredded and compressed in a machine which is specifically deisgned to crush them. The processed aluminium is then melted and poured into moulds waiting to be shaped later.

During the shaping process, the metal is rolled out into long sheets which have thickness ranging from 2.5mm to 6mm, depending on the purpose. Subsequently, these long rolling sheets are turned into cans again. It is reported that 74 per cent of aluminium cans are reused in the UK.
