The following bar chart compares the difference between modes of transport for commuters in a European city in three different years which are 1960, 1980 and 2000.

In the train category, it started below 20% in 1960 and rose to 28% in 1980. Despite the trend of increase in the previous years, it then fell to 21% by 2000.

The use of cars increased steadily from just over 5% in 1960 to 23% in 1980 and finally peaked at 38% in 2000. However, the popularity of buses went down from 38% in 1960 to 27% in 1980 and bottomed at 15% in 2000.

In contrast, the trend of tube use remained relatively constant, falling from 27% in 1960 to 21% in 1980, but climbing back to 25% by 2000.

The chart demonstrates that the use of cars has become ubiquitous between 1960 and 2000, whereas the trend of buses went in the opposite direction, from being the most common way of commuting in 1960 to the least popular in 2000.
