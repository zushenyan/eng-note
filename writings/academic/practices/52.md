The following diagram demonstrates the electricity production by a system called Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC). Overall, the main components involving the whole process are seawater, solar energy,  turbines, an evaporation chamber and a condensing chamber.

To begin with, warm seawater from the sea surface, which can be up to 29 degrees Celsius, is introduced to the evaporation chamber. During the process, the solar energy heats the warm seawater, and after it boils, the seawater is separated into vapour and salt in the evaporation chamber. Following this, saltless water vapour is passed onto turbines to generate electricity. After it powers turbines, used water vapour goes to the condensing chamber for pure water creation.

Separated salt water from the evaporation chamber is mixed with the cold seawater, which can be down to 5 degrees Celsius and drained from 1000 deep under the sea surface. Later, they are used for cooling the condensing chamber to help to create pure water. Subsequently, the used salt water is discharged into the sea. The whole process can be repeated.
