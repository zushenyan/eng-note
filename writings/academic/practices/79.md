The table below demonstrates the changes in household types in Canada from 1984 to 2020.

The single-typed household had doubled during this period, from 6% in 1984 to 12% in 2020. As for one-family households, the proportion of couples without children rose from 19% in 1984 to 25% in 2020. On the other hand, couples with dependent children had dropped significantly from 52% in 1984 to 36% in 2020, while the category "couples with non-dependent children" was also facing a similar trend. However, "couples with non-dependent children" didn't drop as much as "couples with dependent children" did, with only a slight downward, starting at 10% in 1984 and ending at 9% in 2020. In contrast, the figure of lone parents had tripled over the same period, rising from 4% in 1984 to 12% in 2020.

In conclusion, the table indicates clear patterns of change within the Canadian family over the 40 years, particularly the decline in the traditional family model.
