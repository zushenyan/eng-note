The following map depicts two potential sites for constructing a new supermarket near the town of Garlsdon.

The first possible location is S1 lying 12 km away to the southeast of Hindon. The site is in the countryside of Garlsdon so it could accommodate many more parking lots for cars, which makes it more friendly to shoppers travelling by car. Another advantage is that it is close to the railway, which helps the accessibility and thus it enables people to shop here by train.

In contrast, the second suggested proposal is in the centre of Garlsdon. For residents living nearby, this choice would be a great benefit due to convenience, and it is theoretically accessible by railway from surrounding towns. However, considering it is in a no-traffic zone, the parking lots would be fewer, which makes it less friendly to shoppers travelling by car.

To conclude, neither location is appropriate for all towns, but for customers in Hindon, Garlsdon and Cransdon, S1, the out-of-town site would offer more advantages.
