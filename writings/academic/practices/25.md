The following graph depicts the amount spent on six consumer goods in four European countries.

Through observing the chart, we can see that Britain is taking the lead across all categories of consumer goods. For some types of products, for example, photographic film, toys and CDs, the money difference between Britain and the country spending the least is about twice or more.

France and Italy, in most cases, have roughly the same expense. France surpasses Italy in photographic film, toys and CDs while Italy spends more than France on perfumes, tennis racquets and personal stereos.

On the other hand, Germany almost always ranks the least or the second least compared to the rest countries. Only in two cases, which are perfumes and tennis racquets, does this country have a higher amount of expenditure. Another exception is personal stereos in which Germany is on a par with France regarding the spent amount.

Given the statistics, it is clear that the spending habits are significantly different in Europe.
