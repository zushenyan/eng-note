The following two maps show the changes in the Pacific Railway Station between 1998 and now. Overall, we can tell that not only has the number of its platform increased but also the facilities.

In 1998, there were only four platforms. However, it has been increased to seven in total, which reflects the expansion of traffic needs. On the other hand, basic amenities have been increased. Back in 1998, there were toilets sitting on the left of the platforms, whereas it has been razed and replaced by two shops and a restaurant in the present time. In addition to that, a shop that was originally lined up with a cafe and a ticket office has now been expanded by one and relocated to the left. A new supermarket located to the bottom left of the map has opened.

To sum up, the Pacific Railway station has been renovated extensively, including its infrastructure and amenities.
