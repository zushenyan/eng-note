The following chart demonstrates the oil production capacity among six Gulf countries from 1990 to 2010.

Both Iraq and Kuwait shared a similar pattern in oil production change. Kuwait started with a close output with Iraq in 1990, 2 and 1.8 million barrels per day, respectively. In the following years, the production amount remained steadily until hitting a high of just below 4 in Iraq and 3.7 in Kuwait in 2010.

Iran had a higher production figure in 1990 than Iraq and Kuwait, with 3 million barrels per day. It then rose to just above 4 in 2010. On the other hand, UAE had the same amount of oil production back in 1990 and 2000. Subsequently, it started rising and reached an apex of 3.8 in 2010.

Qatar and Saudi Arabia are two countries in contrast. Qatar had the lowest figures among those six countries throughout the years. The output fluctuated between 0.2-0.8 and never exceeded 1.0 from 1990 to 2010. On the contrary, Saudi Arabia started with the highest rate at 8.5, exceeding the combined production of Iran, Iraq and Kuwait in 1990, and kept rising sharply in the following years. It was the primary producer and had dominated oil production for at least 20 years.
