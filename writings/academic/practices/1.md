The pie chart on the left illustrates the volume share of Coca-Cola around the globe in 2000, and the line chart on the right-hand side demonstrates Coca-Cola's share prices between 1996 and 2001.

In 2000, Coca-Cola sold approximately 17.1 billion bottles worldwide. North America, which took up the largest proportion of the sales, occupied the market for 30.4%, followed by Latin America, which was the second largest consumer, shared 25.7 per cent of total volume, while Europea and Asia purchased 20.5% and 16.4% respectively, and at last, Africa and Middle East, accounting for the smallest portion, constituted only 7 percentage of the market.

Turning to the share prices, the price of a Coca-Cola's product called Fizzling started at around $35 in 1996, and peaked at nearly $70 in the middle of 1997. After that, it dipped slightly below $60 and culminated again at around $80 in mid-1998. From then on, the price kept going downward until early 2000, followed by a sharp bounce back to $60 in late 2000, but there was a marginal decline at the beginning of 2001.
