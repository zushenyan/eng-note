The map above demonstrates two possible sites for a new school in the vicinity of the town called Canterbury.

The first site (S1) is located northeast of the town. The site is just on the outskirt of the housing zone and is just by the main road. One of the advantages is the traffic location. Since it sits by the main road, it presumably allows parents to drive their children to school. However, the location could be inconvenient for students living in Chartham as the distance is much longer.

The other desired site (S2) is situated in the centre of the town. The upside of this location is that the distances between Sturry and Chartham are pretty equivalent, only 5km and 7km, respectively. It also makes students living in housing areas easier to reach the school. Nevertheless, because no main road directly leads to the school, parents can not take their children by car and drop them right at the school.
