Some people believe that the abuse of social welfare is inevitable. For example, those who don't really need exploit the system to get subsidies. However, social welfare is a sign of an advanced democratic society. It is citizens' right to have a guaranteed minimum income. Here I am going to discuss why it is necessary despite its imperfection.

First of all, critics forget that subsidies to the unemployed have many different forms. Welfare payments go to many kinds of people who are not capable of earning wages, for example, single-parent mothers, the disabled and the sick. Moreover, the unemployed have the right to an income as well. It's not their fault for not having a job, and not to mention that the tax they have paid in the past entitles them to assistance.

The second reason of why social welfare is necessary is that people without any means of support will have a greater chance of committing crimes. The desperately poor inevitably turn to crime, which is a sign of struggle, and besides, it is costly to society. Policing the streets is more expensive than providing subsidies. A policeman's wage could be many times more than a welfare payment.

Certain members of society point out that social welfare only increases dependency on others and destroys dignity. Thus, people should look after themselves. However, the reason why most of the unemployed need relief payments are that they are living paycheck to paycheck. If they could save up, they would have already done that. Not to mention that families with severely disabled members could drastically burden their financial state.

To sum up, this is vital to understand the necessity of social welfare and why it is crucial to a modern democratic society. Without welfare payments, the poor are destined to be more miserable. It is the government's duty to provide financial aid for all disadvantaged people, including those without work.
