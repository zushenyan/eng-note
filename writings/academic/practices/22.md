The following graph illustrates the gold sales in Dubai for 12 months in 2002 in millions of Dirhams.

Starting from January, the price rose drastically from 200 and peaked at 350 in March, followed by a decrease in the next four months. The decline didn't stop until it hit a low of 120 million dirhams in July.

In August, a sales spike made the price recover from 120 to 210 million dirhams. Despite the bounce, in September, it fell back to the same figure as July. Moving on to October, a resurge of sales made the sales number bottom out from 120 to 180 million dirhams, and the status lasted for three months.

Overall, we can tell that the main sale period was in the early part of the year, plunging in Summer, except for a sudden increase in August, followed by a slight drop in September, and recovered in Winter.
