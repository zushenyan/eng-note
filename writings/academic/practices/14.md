The table below depicts the hours of casual time people of different ages spend in Someland. The range of age across teenagers to elders. The activities are divided into six different categories.

According to the figures, people spend a good proportion of time on home entertainment such as watching TV and cinema. In both cases, teenagers and retired people spend nearly twice as much time as people of working age. Home entertainment ranges from over a thousand hours for teenagers and retired people and 600 hours on average for the rest of the ages. Cinema accounts for around 100 hours of both juniors' and seniors' free time and 20 to 50 hours for the rest.

Regarding the hours of social life across people of different ages, the hour of socialising with four or fewer people peaks at 300 hours in the 30s and the numbers for the remaining age groups fluctuate between 150 and 250 hours. The hours of socialising with four or more people start at 350 hours for people below 30s, and it plunges to 50 hours in the 30s and 40s group. The group and individual exercises share similar patterns of socialising.

To summarise, there is a significant trend towards a solitary and smaller group of activities as people age and teenagers and elders spend more time on entertainment than those who need to work.
