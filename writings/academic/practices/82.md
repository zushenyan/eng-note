The charts show the prediction for projections for global production by sector between 2040 and 2060, with six different categories. Generally, there is little change in the projected proportion of production by various sectors in two years, with manufacturing and services being the most dominant.

It is forecast that the services and manufacturing sectors will keep dominating the projected production, accounting for more than half of global production in 2040 and 2060, 71%(40% and 31%) and 74%(41% and 33%), respectively. In contrast, the proportion of production from energy is expected to decline from 7% in 2040 to 5% in 2060, a drop of approximately one-third. It is also anticipated that a similar drastic fall in agriculture production from 4% to 1%. On the other hand, the materials sector will consist of 4% in 2060 compared to 3% in 2040.

As regards the info-com tech sector, there is expected to be a little difference in the proportion of production the group constitutes, with a slight rise from 15% to 16% over the period.
