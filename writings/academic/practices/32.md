The following line graph illustrates cinema attendance in the UK from 1990 to 2010. The age groups are divided into four.

Younger people who were between 14 to 24 had a high tendency to go to movie theatres between 1990 to 2010. The proportion started at 37% in 1990 and kept fluctuating until 2000. In the following years, the number spiked to 47% in 2005 and culminated above 50% in 2010.

For younger adults between 24 to 34, the figure was 45% in 1990. In 2000, the number hit a low of 32% and then peaked at 44% in 2010. The trend for the 34-44 years old group shared a similar pattern, whereas it started at a lower rate, with 24% only, and between 2005 and 2010, the number remained the same at 32%.

The older adults always shared the lowest percentage in movie attendance rate, and there wasn't much change between 1990 to 2010. The number started at 15% in 1990, and in the next 20 years, it only increased by approximately 6% in 2010.
