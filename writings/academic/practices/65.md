The following chart illustrates information about oversea students studying in four English-speaking countries, namely the USA, the UK, Australia and Canada, in 2004 and 2012.

Firstly, let's look at the figures for the USA. Though the percentages remained the same in 2004 and 2012, the total number of foreign students had increased from 175000 to almost 250000. If we compare the number of students in the UK between 2004 and 2012, the percentages increased by 4%. It also reflects that the sum of international students had gone up from 125000 to about 200000.

Move on to Australia. Though it started with the same number of students as the UK, it occupied most among the four English-based countries, about 19%. The number later increased to 24% in 2012. Let's move our focus to the last country - Canada. In 2004, it began at 5%, whereas it had grown to 7% in 2012 while it had a significantly lower number of students comparing the rest of the three countries.

In conclusion, the total number of oversea students increased in these four English-speaking countries. Australia had the most increase; the UK ranked second; Canada ranked fourth; the USA was the last.
