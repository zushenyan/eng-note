The diagrams below show how frozen fish pies are made through a series of processes. According to the second diagram, there are two major components involved.

A fish pie is a food product wrapped in a microwaveable container which contains fish and peas submerged with a large amount of sauce, layered with potatoes on its surface.

In terms of production, the first component is the process of potatoes. Potatoes in less than one month are delivered to a factory where they are cleaned, peeled and chopped into slices. After this, sliced potatoes are put into pots and pans for cooking. Followed by boiling and chilling, the potatoes are passed to storage for the second part.

The second process involves dealing with fish. Fresh salmons are sent to a production line where they are seasoned with lemon juice and salt. No more than 12 hours, the seasoned salmon are sent to an oven for steaming. Subsequently, skin and bones are removed manually and well-inspected for quality assurance. After this, prepared peas, sauces and cooked potatoes are combined with the cooked fish in this step.

In the final stage, the product is wrapped and frozen in storage. Now the product is ready to be dispatched and sent to stores for sale.
