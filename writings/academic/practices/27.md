The following graph compares the heart attacks in every thousand by age and sex in the US.

In the 29-44 group, 123000 men suffered from heart attacks each year, whereas the number of woman victims can be negligible, with only 3000 people getting heart attacks yearly.

Move on to the 45-64 group. Both sexes' numbers have dramatically increased. The number of men who have suffered from heart attacks increases to 424000 people per year. Shockingly, the figure for women also grows by an immense amount, from 3000 to 136000 per year. The growing proportion of female victims is higher than men, with 45 times more. On the other hand, the number of male victims is roughly three times more than the previous group.

In late adulthood, namely, 65 and higher, in this group, the figure for men has grown slightly to 440000 per year. The number of women also faces an explosive growth, from 136000 to 374000, almost three times more than the previous age range.

Overall, men are more likely to be the victims of heart attacks at all ages, but women are increasingly possibly over 65.
