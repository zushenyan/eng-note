The following diagram demonstrates how honey is produced by bees. Overall, the whole process can be broken down into seven crucial stages.

Since honey is the primary food source for bees, in the beginning, they have to construct their home - commonly a container called a hive, for food storage. After the hive has been constructed, bees send workers to search plants and pick up a material called nectar - a sweet liquid produced by flowers. Subsequently, the collected nectar is then stored in each cell of the hive.

Once the nectar is taken back to a hive, honey production begins. First, bees solidify the nectar-filled cells by fanning their wings to cool down the nectar, after which honey is then let to lose its water content. This stage is where the honey is shaped, with a process called water evaporation. Following this, the honey we know is produced, and it is ready to be used now.
