The bar chart below, divided into five different employment statuses, depicts the number of hours of leisure time that men and women had from 1998 to 1999.

In the employed full-time section, men had approximately 44 hours, whereas women had only 38 hours. What the numbers could imply was that women carried out most of the housework.

Among those employed part-time workers, there was no statistic given for males, but for females, the free time had risen to 41 hours, only slightly more than women who were full-time employed.

Turn to unemployed and retired sections. It is no surprise that people without a job or retired have more time of their own. The leisure time for males and females in both groups had climbed to 82 hours and 70 hours, respectively. Once again, it could reflect that women shouldered most of the housework.

Lastly, for housewives and househusbands, there were no figures given for househusbands in this section. On average, housewives enjoyed roughly 55 hours of leisure time.

Overall, the chart demonstrates that in the categories for which statistics on male leisure time were available, men enjoyed at least 10 hours of extra leisure time than women.
