The following maps demosntrate the changes in the city of Nelson between 2000 and the present time. Overall, we can see the area has been almost completely reconstructed. Many infrastructures and amenites have been added, such as recidential building, shopping centre and so on.

In 2000, the old market was located in the west to the city centre, whereas now it has been moved to the east direction of the city centre and fully renovated. The original building has been replaced by a store intead. Furthermore, the train station situated in the north-west of the city centre has been been relocated to the north instead. In the north direction was a university which remains the same, but at the present time, it is connected to the city centre with a tramline. In the north-east of the map is the shopping center, where there used to be a forest. In the north-west is the hall of residence, but it used to be an unused field. As for the city centre itself, the surrounding of the main building has now been added with bike rental service.

Moving to the south of the map, the road in 2000 is now a pedestrain only street. The port remains the same, but bars and restaurants are built in order to attract more tourists by using the beautiful river scene.
