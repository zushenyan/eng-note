It's known that eating sugary foods could make our mouth acid such that it leads to tooth decay. Here is a line graph comparing the acidity level over 40 minutes after consuming three different sources of sugar.

It indicates that below PH level 5.5 is the degree that could conduce tooth decay. All three types of sugar dramatically dropped from PH level 7 within the first 5 minutes of consumption. The one that sinks most is the cane sugar which drops to 3.5, and it's also the one that lowers the PH level for the most extended period. The PH level doesn't recover until approximately 30 minutes pass.

The fruit sugar, making the PH level fall to 4.25, brings the acidity level down to the second-lowest place. However, it doesn't prolong as the cane sugar does, which means it's less likely to pose a danger of decay to our teeth.

Among the rest source of sugar, honey seems like the most healthy for the tooth. It dips just a little below level 5 after 5 minutes of ingestion. It is also worth noting that it only takes 10 minutes to recover from the possible tooth-decaying level, which makes honey the most friendly sugar in terms of tooth health.
