The graph below compares the smoking rates in Someland between men and women from 1960 to 2000.

The number of male smokers set out at the rate of 600 in every 1000 people in 1960. It had gradually declined since then, and as of 1970, the decreasing rates of male smokers had slightly enhanced. The trend of shrinking smokers in males hadn't stopped and ended up roughly 250 in every 1000 people in the year 2000.

In contrast, the figures for women smokers, despite hitting a low of 80 in 1960 for once, had risen progressively in later years, and peaked at 320 during 1975-1980. However, in 1985, the tide turned. The rates of female smokers began to decline steadily year by year and dropped to 200 in 2000.

In conclusion, it can be seen that there was a trend of decline in smoking for both men and women. Throughout the whole period, men always had a higher level of smoking rate than women.
