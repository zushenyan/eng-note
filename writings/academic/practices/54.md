The following diagram illustrates a possible way to produce energy for home use in the future. The equipment consists of a large tank filled with compost, some storage, a compressor, an engine and a generator.

The process begins with a tank 3/4 filled with a mix of compost and water. In this tank, besides water, the compost ingredients can be leaves, food or craps and so on. After adding compost ingredients, the mixture ferments a fuel called methane gas, which is then stored in gas storage for a series of advanced processing.

Once the methane gas has passed through a compressor, it is sent to a combustion engine to generate mechanical energy. Having been passed onto the generator, the mechanical energy is then transformed into electrical power. Following this is the final stage. There is a battery for storing the generated electricity, and finally, the electricity is ready for home use.
