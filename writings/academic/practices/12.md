The graphs below show the correlation between deaths and medical research funding for six diseases in Someland in 1990.

After analysing the charts, it can be seen that AIDS caused 0.25 million deaths, Leprosy 0.1 million deaths, Tropical Diseases 0.3 million deaths, Diarrhoea 0.5 million deaths, Malaria 0.4 million deaths and TB 1.75 million deaths. However, the funding for each disease was - AIDS 175 million dollars, Leprosy 75 million dollars, Tropical Diseases 75 million dollars, Diarrhoea 60 million dollars, Malaria 50 million dollars and TB 25 million dollars.

In conclusion, we can acknowledge that the death toll and the research funding for each disease didn't always grow proportionally. For example, 0.25 people died of AIDS, but the cost of funding was the most in 1990. On the other hand, TB had the highest number of death, whereas the money put into research was the least in the same year, which was the opposite case compared to AIDS.
