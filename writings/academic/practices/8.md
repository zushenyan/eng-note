The chart below indicates the hours of unpaid work per week between men and women in different scenarios, from no children to 3 and more children in a home. The unpaid jobs are childcare, house chores and gardening.

In households without children, it reports that women spend 30 hours per week in unpaid household work while men sit below 20 hours per week.

Turn to homes with 1 to 2 children. The time women spend on housework dramatically soars to 52 hours per week, which is a 57% increase compared to families without kids. However, the unpaid work hour for men remains almost unchanged. Undoubtedly, the care of children causes the increment of unpaid hours for women.

In the third figure, the hour of housework for women slightly rises to 55 hours per week. Surprisingly, the time men spend on childcare, housework, and gardening even falls to 18 hours from 20 hours per week.

Overall, the data suggests the increased presence of children in households has yet to lead to an increased role for men but only increases the burden on women.
