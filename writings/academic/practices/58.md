The following maps illustrate the improvements that have been made to a university campus between 2010 and the present day. Overall, we can see that many buildings are getting expanded and integrated extensively.

In 2010, commercial amenities like a restaurant and shops were scattered around the campus. However, in the present day, it has been integrated into a single building - a student facilities building, which used to be a student accommodation, now it is an amenity that not only does it include the shops, but also the office. The original location of the office has now been the science building. Furthermore, the teaching block in 2010 has been changed into an arts building at the present time.

One of the worth-mentioning changes to the campus is the student accommodations have been increased. There used to be two, but now they are three to accommodate more students. Another change is the lake. Compared to the previous size in 2010, the lake has now been reduced due to the removal of the lawn & seating area. In addition, a new road that leads to one of the student accommodations has been paved.
