The first map above shows the vicinity of the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Tower situats by the Seine river in Paris. Near the Eiffel tower, there are some other buildings. For example, one of the world-famous tour spots - Musee du Louvre - is also sitting by the Seine river.

The Eiffel Tower is a 324-meter-high, 10100-tonnes-weight building with two viewing platforms. The first viewing platform is 57m high from the ground, and the second is 115m high. If tourists want to move from the first viewing platform to the second one, it takes 1665 steps to get there.

There is a plan to build the foundations of tower. The foundation is a five floors underground structure that will incorporate the ticket office, shops, restaurants, cinema, museum and parking lots. Although details are not revealed, two lifts will be included to ship passengers vertically. There will also be a large glass ceiling on the first level for the visitors to see the tower directly.
