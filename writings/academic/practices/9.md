The table below, a study from Canada, demonstrates the sleeping routine between five different occupations.

For students, the sleeping pattern is quite regular. Knowing that the main activity of a student is going to school during the daytime, this is not surprising that students sleep consecutively for 8 hours a day. 

Another occupation with a continuous sleep is the business executives who only have a 6-hour period each night, from 11 p.m to 5 a.m. It is likely to be the stressful nature of their job and duty.

Move on to the truck drivers. Interestingly, the sleep for a day is split into two segments. They tend to sleep for 3 hours, get up and work, and sleep for another 3 hours. It is because they have to catch up with the itinerary.

Doctors and full-time mothers share the same pattern. However, because of the nature of babies, full-time mothers have way more broken sleep styles since they have to get up and take care of their children. On the other hand, doctors tend to retire to bed around 1 a.m. and start their day at 7 a.m, but may be woken up owing to emergencies.
