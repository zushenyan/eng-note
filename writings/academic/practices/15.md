The following illustration demonstrates the relation between computers and internet availability per capita in the Arab world.

According to the graph, UAE has the highest numbers of computer and internet users, with 150 and 340 per 1000 residents, respectively. Kuwait ranks second place. Of every 1000 people, 130 have computers, and 100 can access the Internet. Lebanon is the third most highly computerised country, with 50 per 1000 habitants owning computers and 80 internet users in every thousand.

Another interesting fact is that the number of internet users does not always grow with the figure of computer users. Taking UAE as an example, the amount of internet users is twice as much as the number of computer users. This pattern can also be observed in countries like Jordan, Lebanon and Oman.

In summary, there is a vast difference in the ratios of computer and internet users between countries. UAE is absolutely taking the lead in terms of computerisation.
