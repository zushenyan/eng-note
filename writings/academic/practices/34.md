The chart below depicts the figures for imprisonment in five countries from 1930 to 1980.

In Great Britain, the number of imprisonment hadn't stopped increasing steadily since 1930. In 1980, the number fell from nearly 70 to below 50. 

In Australia, the number started at 70 in 1930, gradually dropping until 1960. Later, the figure rose again, hitting a high of around 70 in 1970. Finally, it slipped back to 50 in 1980.

As for New Zealand, a v-shaped trend shows up. It began with 100 in 1930, falling to 50 in the next decade. Despite the falling number of imprisonment in the previous decade, it had kept rising since then and finally peaked at about 90 in 1980.

The figure for the US fluctuated very often. No primary trend shows up in the graph, but one obvious thing for sure is that the imprisonment rate was relatively higher than in the rest of the nominated countries. In 1980, the number even culminated in over 130, which is a worrying trend.

The last one is Canada. Overall, there was a fluctuation between 1940 and 1960, yet a downward trend emerged over the periods. It can be a good sign, although many factors are involved, and thus we can't conclude so early.

In conclusion, no shared pattern appears among these listed countries. In fact, there is a fluctuation from country to country.
