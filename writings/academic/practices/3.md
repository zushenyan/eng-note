In these three graphs, they illustrate three different genres of music albums bought by people from age 16 to 45+, and they also demonstrate the proportion of the audience by sex.

In pop and rock music categories, there is no significant difference between these two types. Both male and female customers are sitting just below 30% and 20%, respectively. Among these three graphs, people from 16 to 44 occupy the major of rock and pop music, contributing almost 90 per cent in each graph, while 45-year-olds or older only take around 10% of the whole occupation.

By contrast, in the classical music type, the male customer is 9%, and the female customer is 8%, with only a modest difference. Turning to the age, people purchasing classical music are sitting in the age groups of 25 to 34 or 45 and higher. They are 16% and 20%, constituting the primary audience in this music genre. On the other hand, 16 to 24-year-olds and 35 to 44-year-olds only take up hardly below 5% in total.
