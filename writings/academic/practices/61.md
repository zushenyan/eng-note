The following chart illustrates the average number of hours each day for four countries' tourists spending time on leisure activities while staying in Greece in August 2019 on holiday. The leisure activities were at the beach, reading books and visiting places.

Overall, the last time-spending activity was visiting places. It took only 9 hours in total each day for tourists from four countries, and Chinese tourists were the least, only 1 hour each day.

By contrast, the second time-spending leisure activity was staying at the beach, with a total of 18 hours each day. Chinese tourists ranked last in this category, with only 3 hours per day, whereas Brazilian tourists spent 6 hours each day on average, twice times higher as Chinese tourists.

The most time-consuming activity among these three was reading books, with a sum of 21 hours each day. Chinese tourists spent 8 hours reading books per day, yet Turkish and Brazilian tourists spent the least time, with only half of the time in comparison to Chinese tourists.
