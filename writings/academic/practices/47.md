The table above shows the salaries needed for different sizes of bedrooms in three distinct areas in London. The cost depends on how many bedrooms it has. In general, as the size of the property increases, the cost also increases.

The most expensive area is Notting Hill. The price ranges from 375 to 740 pounds per week for properties with 1 to 3 bedrooms. To rent in this area, salaries need to be at least 98000 for a single bedroom. If one wants to rent a 3-bedroom property, the salary has to be at least 195000 to afford the cost.

On the other hand, Fulham is the cheapest area with rents ranging from 215 per week for a single bedroom to 600 per week for a 3-bedroom property. To rent in Fulham, salaries need to be between 55000 to 160000 depending on the number of bedrooms required.

For those who can pay in the middle price range for accommodation, Regent's Park might be a suitable district, as the rents and the required salaries sit between the mentioned areas.
