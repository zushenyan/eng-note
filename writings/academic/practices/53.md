The maps below show what had changed at Queen Mary Hospital from 1960 to 2000, over 40 years course in total.

In 1960, the hospital sat by the main road and was next to a shopping centre and car park. Each three shared roughly equivalent land in size. There was farmland sitting diagonally to the hospital.

In 1980, the shopping centre was demolished. Instead, a cancer centre and a pharmacy were built right next to the hospital. As for the farmland, it was converted into a nursing school.

In 2000, the original cancer centre was expanded to the area that was originally designated as a nursing school. Furthermore, the car park was divided into two - one for the moved nursing school and the other for the original parking lots.

During that period, the Queen Mary Hospital had increased in size, and besides that, it gained a nursing school and a cancer centre.
