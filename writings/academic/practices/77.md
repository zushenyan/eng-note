The first table illustrates people's reasons to stop smoking, and the second chart gives information about when they intend to give up doing it. 

For the first chart, the main reason smokers consider stopping smoking is "for better health in general", with 64% in heavy smokers and 73% in medium smokers, followed by 74% in light smokers. The reason that ranks second is "financial considerations." 31%, 36% and 25% of smokers gave this reason in "20 and more", "10 to 19" and "fewer than 10" number of cigarettes smoked per day groups, respectively. The third one is trying to avoid "smoking-related diseases", with around 25% on average among these number of cigarettes smoked groups.

According to the second table, the majority of smokers, roughly 71% in total, intended to give up smoking. In addition, 21% of smokers said that they were planning to quit smoking within the following year. On the other hand, only 12% of smokers had the idea of quitting smoking, whereas 35% of smokers had the plan to do so within the next six months, which is almost three times more than the former group. To sum up the second graph, about one-third of smokers didn't have a plan to do so, which perhaps reflects the level of addiction.
