The following line graph shows the crucial motivation of why people relocated to the capital city of a specific country between 2000 and 2015. There were four major reasons in terms of moving.

The motivation with the highest amount of figures among these four was employment. Starting at 60000 in 2000, with a dramatic increase by around 25000 in 2005, peaking at 92000 in 2010, whereas it finished at roughly 87000 in 2015. In addition, this was the only category that underwent a downturn.

Turning to the second highest reason - for study. Though this category began at 25000 in 2000, it then rose significantly to 48000 in 2005, with a gentle growth of around 54000 in 2010, and then again in 2015, the number skyrocketed to 87000.

Meanwhile, the number of people relocating for "family or friends" went up steadily, starting from 11000 to 15000, in 2000 and 2005, respectively, followed by a mild growth to approximately 23000 in 2010, before eventually levelling off at around 25000 in 2015. Likewise, the reason for adventure rose the most stably of all four categories, from 11000 to 15000 over the fifteen years.
