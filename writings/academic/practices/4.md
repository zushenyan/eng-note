The graphs below illustrate the number of employees in Freedonia by sex in six industries between 1975 and 1995.

Comparing these two charts, we can tell that some sectors didn't change much. For example, the number of female employees was 650,000 in the public sector, while men sat at 850,000 in 1975. Interestingly, it remained the same in 1995. The manufacturing section shared the same situation. The total number of women employees was 300,000, and men were roughly 625,000 in 1975, and still so in 1995.

We can also observe some different statistics. In the communication sector, the male employee was around 300,000 people, while female workers were only slightly behind. However, in 1995, the tide turned. The number of female employees roseÂ sharply by 300,000. In the wholesale & retail trade industry, the number of females started at 250,000, yet, in 1995, the number of female workers climbed to 550,000, which significantly suppressed the number of males, which kept at 300,000 since 1975.
