The graph below demonstrates the cost of fast foods grouped by income in the UK in 1990.

For hamburgers, it can be seen that there was a positive relationship between the cost and the income. High-salary earners had a tendency to spend at least 40 dollars on hamburgers. As for the average and low-income earners, they spent 33 and 14 dollars, respectively.

Turn to fish & chips. There wasn't a clear relationship between the salary and dietary preference. For the high-income group, the amount of money was $16, and the average-income group was $25. Interestingly, the low-income group spent the same amount of money as the high-income group, with $16 in 1990.

Finally, for the cost of pizza, it shared the same trend as hamburgers. Top earners spent 18 dollars on consuming pizza, but in terms of the average earners, they tended to spend less, with 11 dollars on average. Lastly, for the low-income group, the average cost dropped to 6 dollars.

In conclusion, the amount of money spent on fast food is related to income, and the preference for fast food roughly shares a similar result.
