The flowchart shows how to manufacture a commodity from raw materials to put it for sale to the customer.

The process begins with having raw materials and manufactured components stored in the warehouse, followed by the production planning following requirements from the design team. After assembly and inspection, the process moves on to the quality assurance department for testing. Those units that pass testing are then packaged and dispatched to retail stores for sale. The level of sales, the final stage of the whole process, helps determine production planning.

When it comes to product design, it is not only a result of the product research but also influenced by the feedback from the market research and the result of testing. If the QA department finds any flaw, it reports it to the design team such that the design team can incorporate the feedback into a new iteration of production planning. Likewise, the market research also researches demand and reports it back to the design team to help to make improvements. Furthermore, the marketing team also takes advantage of the sales statistics to foster future sales by devising new strategies for advertisement and packaging.
