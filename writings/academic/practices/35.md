The table below demonstrates the consumer durables owned in Britain in percentages from 1972 to 1983.

Overall, there was an increasing trend in all consumer durables among UK households. In 1983, domestic appliances with a significant increase in number were telephone, central heating and refrigerator, with 35%, 25% and 21%, respectively. Other durables also rose steadily over the period of 11 years. Namely, television, vacuum cleaner and washing machine had climbed by 5%, 8% and 14% separately since 1972. Another worth-mentioning thing was that the dishwasher had gradually become a part of houseware since 1978. In terms of the use of visual devices, about 18% of families in the UK owned video recorders in 1983. The growth was so drastic that it's hard to believe it wasn't on the market until then.

In conclusion, the statistic reflected that people were gradually moving toward a more convenient and comfortable lifestyle. The soar in owning varieties of home appliances is the best evidence of that statement.
