This chart indicates several indices about social and economic status in four countries, Canada, Japan, Peru and Zaire, based on United Nations statistics in 1994.

The first index shows that Canada and Japan had annual incomes of $11000 and $15760 per person in US dollars, respectively. It also indicates a tremendous gap between advanced and low economically developed countries. In this example, Peru and Zaire were only $160 and $130, compared to Canada and Japan.

As for the health indicator, Japan reported the highest life expectancy at birth, 78, followed by Canada, 76; Peru, 51; and Zaire, 47. It could reflect that more affluent societies could put more money into health care than poorer ones.

Literacy rates among adults were higher in wealthier countries. Canada had the same rate as Japan, 99%, while Peru reported 68%. Zaire, with the least adult literacy rate of the four countries, had a rate of 34%.
