The following line chart illustrates the yearly income trend of three bakeries from 2000 to 2010 in Calgary. Overall, two bakeries experienced a sharp income rise, while one had a considerable fall between 2005 to 2008.

Looking at the details of Bolo Cakery, the income started at $ 20000 in 2000, and then there was a fluctuation in the next three years, at which point it levelled off at around $40000 until 2006. Following the next two years, the income rose significantly to just $60000 in 2008, finishing at roughly $61000 in 2010.

Amandine Bakery shares a similar pattern with Bolo Cakery. Having remained stable in the first half-decade, the income began booming in 2005, reaching nearly $100000 in 2008, following a mild growth to approximately $100500 in 2010.

On the contrary, Mari Bakeshop experienced the opposite situation to the other two competitors. Although the income started at $80000 in 2000, it then went erratic in the next few years, keeping the range between $80000 to $100000 until 2004. After that, despite plunging to above $40000 in 2008, the figure levelled off in the last two years.
