The following graphs depict the main reasons for studying among students of different ages and the amount of support they have received from their employers.

In the first graph, we can see that the trend of studying for their career and the studying for interest go in an inversed direction. The number of learning for career peaks at 80% in the age under the 26-year-old group, and declines as people age, while it hits the low of 18% in late adulthood.

Conversely, the figures for studying out of interest grow when employees grow older. It starts at 10% for people under 26 and crosses at 40% with the group of 40-49 years old. The trend reaches the apex at 70% for people over 49.

Turn to the employer support graph. The support rate culminates at 64% in the beginning, followed by a fall to 34% in the group of 30-39 years old. However, in the following age groups, the number recovers in the older group up to 44%.

To conclude, it is unclear whether the employer support is only for career-focused study, but 
the highest level is for those students who mainly study for career purposes.
