The chart above illustrates the interaction between the gas-cooled nuclear reactor and the heat exchanger.

The reactor consists of uranium fuel elements wrapped by graphite moderators and topped with boron control rods in a pressure vessel. The pressure vessel itself is inside a concrete radiation shielding device for protection. Boron control rods are partially exposed outside, and the exposed parts are connected to the concrete radiation shielding with charge tubes for loading fuel elements.

The hot gas inside the reactor flows through a tube to the heat exchanger outside the reactor. The heat exchanger has a water circulator to take in water to cool down the hot gas, and the water turns into steam and flows to the turbo alternator. After that, the cooled gas is sent to the reactor again by an equipment called gas blower.

As it can be seen, the whole continuous cycle demonstrates how the heat exchanger prevents the reactor from overheating.
