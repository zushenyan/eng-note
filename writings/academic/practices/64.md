The pie charts below illustrate the employment of part-time and full-time jobs between the two genders in 1998 and 2012 in the UK.

Compared with 1998, the most significant change was the decrease in the men's workforce in proportion overall. The amount of men with a full-time job was 53 per cent in 1998, but it fell to 47 per cent in 2012, 12539000 and 13794000 people in total, respectively. As for men with a part-time job, it slightly declined from 7 per cent in 1998 to 6 per cent in 2012.

By contrast, women with a full-time job has tremendously climbed from 19 per cent in 1998 to 26 per cent in 2012. The total number of females had increased by almost 40000 during 14 years. However, women working in part-time jobs had dropped by 2 per cent compared with the data between 1998 and 2012.

In conclusion, though the total number of employed people had increased from 23839000 in 1998 to 29600000 in 2012, the sum of the male employee had gone down sequentially due to the raising number of female employees.
