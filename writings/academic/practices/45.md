The graph above shows how the 2700 km long islands in the centre of the Pacific Ocean were formed from a geology perspective. Hawaii is actually formed by a series of islands sized from 10 to 100 km. To name them from northwest to southeast, Niihau, Kauai, Oah, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, Kahoolawe and Hawaii main island.

It is believed that it all started about 80 million years ago. A hot spot existed on the ocean bed, which caused a series of eruptions and produced magma originating roughly 2800 km deep. It later built up volcanoes through numerous eruptions, and eventually, they emerged above sea level.

Since then, the hot spot spume has remained static as the Pacific tectonic plate moves in a northwest direction at a speed of 7~9 cm per year. It was how the major islands of Hawaii were formed.
