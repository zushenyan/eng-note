The following chart depicts the number of Japanese tourists travelling abroad between 1985 and 1995, and the other illustrates Australia's share of Japan's tourist market from 1985 to 1994.

In the figure for Japanese tourists travelling aboard, we can see a positive trend within ten years. In 1985, 5 million people went aboard for a visit. The number kept growing until 1991, and with a slight drop compared to the previous year, it bounced back from just above 10 million to nearly 12 million people. The trend didn't show any sign of dip and reached about 15 in 1995.

Turn to the share of the Japanese tourist market in Australia. In 1985, only 2 per cent of Japanese would come to Australia for a tour. The number rose considerably in the following years and peaked at nearly 5% in 1988, whereas it fellÂ to 4.1% in the next year. Despite the fluctuation, the figure came back in 1990 and was on the rise until hitting a high of 6.1% in 1993 and then declined marginally by roughly 0.1% in 1994.

To conclude, these two graphs indicate a relationship between the number of tourists and the percentage of Japanese tourist occupation in Australia. However, considering the numbers in 1988, in spite of the fact that the number of Japanese tourists grew, the tourist market went down, and thus this shows that the trends in these two graphs don't always go along with each other.
