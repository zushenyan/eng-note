The table below shows a restaurant's sales during the week of October 7th to 13th.

By reading the numbers of the lunch sales, we can see that the sales fluctuated between 2400$ and 2600$ during the weekdays, followed by a fall to just below 2000$ on Saturday and a plummet to 1550$ on Sunday.

The dinner sales shared a similar pattern to lunch sales, whereas the sales averaged roughly 1000$ more than the lunch sales. However, a critical statistic that makes the two different is that on Friday night, the dinner sales peaked at 4350$, which was at least 900$ more than the low of sales during weekdays.

What made the figures for lunch remain steadily during weekdays but fall on the weekend could be the restaurant location. If it was in a business district, it could attract people by having lunch during a midday break, which also explains the fall in sales on the weekend since the frequent customers go to other places for a change in diet.
