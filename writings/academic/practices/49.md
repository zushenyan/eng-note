The flowchart above illustrates the making of cloured plastic paper clips in a small factory. There are fours stages in total for the making of plastic paper clips. Two of them involve the preparation of the clips, while the rest two consist of the quality control.

To begin with, molten plastic is poured into three different coloured moulds, which are red, blue and yellow. Once the clips are coloured and shaped, they are sent to the quality control machines for strength checking. Unsatisfactory clips are rejected.

Move on to the next stage. These clips are sorted into two different groups by hand. One is the mixed colours group, and the other one is the single colours group. After that, clips are passed onto another stage of quality assurance to ensure clips are placed in the correct batches.

In the final stage, clips are packed and sent to retailers to be sold to the public.
