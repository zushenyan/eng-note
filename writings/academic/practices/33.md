The graph below demonstrates the employment rates divided by sex and are grouped into six countries from 1995 to 2005.

The most obvious trend was that the employment rates had greatly improved among all listed countries. For example, in Australia, the employment rate was 55 per cent for men and 27 per cent for women to have a job in 1995, whereas the figures for menÂ and women jumped to nearly 70 per cent and 40 per cent in 2005, respectively.

The second conspicuous trend was that the number of female workers had increased over the decade in these countries. Although the percentages of female workers still lagged behind men in 2005, the increased proportion of female employees indicated the disparity between sex had decreased.

In conclusion, all the listed countries showed at least a 10 per cent improvement for both men and women. While men still had a relatively higher employment rate, more and more women appeared to be entering the labour market to be a part of the workforce.
