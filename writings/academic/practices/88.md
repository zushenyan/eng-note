The following two graphs illustrate the number of participants entering the Olympics. The bar chart shows the number of male and female participants. The line chart displays information about the total number of participants. Both graphs demonstrate figures between 1924 and 2012.

It is evident from the bar chart that the number of female participants entering the Olympics rose dramatically over the century. In 1924, there were below 100 females in the Olympics. In 1952 and 1984, the numbers of women players increased to 500 and 1500, respectively. In 2012, however, the number rose drastically to nearly 5000, with only approximately 1000 difference between the number of male participants.

Turn to the total number of participants. The line graph shares a similar trend with the bar chart, with the number of participants increasing throughout the 100 years. The most significant change was seen between 1984 and 2012 when the number of athletes climbed from right above 6000 in 1984 to over 10000 in 2012.

To sum up, since 1924, the number of athletes entering the Olympics has gone up considerably. It is particularly true for women, who are now represented in nearly the same numbers as male participants.
