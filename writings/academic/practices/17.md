Here we have two diagrams, one for illustrating the expenditure on health & education in percentage of GDP in UAE from 1985 to 1993, and the other for the infant mortality and life expenditure from 1970 to 1992.

In the first graph, we can tell that the expenditure on health started at near 8% of the GDP in 1985, and later it slightly dropped to 7% in 1990. However, it later rose to 10% in 1993, more than in previous years. As for theÂ cost of education, in 1985, it started at 10% and gradually increased since then, and peaked at 15% in 1993.

Analysing the first graph with the second one, we can tell that by adding more expenditure on health and education, the death toll of babies dramatically fell, from 70 per 1000 births in 1970 to 20 in 1992. The increasing expenses also influenced the life expectancy in UAE. In 1970, people were expected to live up to 60 years, whereas in 1992, it rose to 70 years.

In conclusion, from these two graphs, we can tell that the expenditure on health and education plays a role in infant mortality and life expectancy.
