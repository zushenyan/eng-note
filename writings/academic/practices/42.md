The following flowchart shows the process involved in requirements for gaining credits from work experience for university students.

The first step is to pick a workplace from an approved list and start interviews with companies. Once the acceptance letter is received, students must submit it to a professor for approval. For the third stage, students have to schedule their time to have ten work hours per week over 20 weeks.

Writing reports is the next stage. Finishing the weekly Report Form and submitting it to a professor every Friday is required in this stage. During the last workweek comes the fourth stage, Evaluation. Students will be arranged an evaluation meeting with their supervisor, who should fill out an Evaluation Form based on their work performance. In the closing phase, Final Report, students must hand in a Final Report before the last week of the spring semester.

Should students want to receive credits from the university, please follow the instructions carefully.
