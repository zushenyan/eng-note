The bar chart below shows the percentages of the Canadian workforce in five major industries between 1850 and 2020. Overall we can see significant growth in the services sector and a fall in manufacturing and agriculture/fishing.

In 1850, the manufacturing sector was one of the top proportions among the Canadian workforce, with 36%. However, in 2020, the figure dropped sharply to 9%. By contrast, though the services industry was also one of the top-occupied categories among these five, the portion had almost raised by tripled, from 33% in 1850 to 81% in 2020. The industry that ranked third was agriculture/fishing. It had gone into free-fall from 22% in 1850 to only 1% in 2020.

On the other hand, construction started at 5% in 1850 and didn't really have obvious change. It only had a 3% increase compared with the years between 1850 and 2020. The last one is the energy sector. The proportion had declined by one-third overall, from 3% in 1850 to 1% in 2020.
