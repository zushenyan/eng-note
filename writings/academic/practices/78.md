Studying English in a nation where it is widely spoken has certain advantages. It is, therefore, a good idea to study in countries such as Britain or Canada. However, this is surely not the only way to learn the language.

In the first place, students should have essential knowledge of writing, reading, speaking and listening in English before learning English aboard. Otherwise, dealing with day-to-day chores such as finding accommodation or paying living costs will be stressful. Hence, having basic knowledge of the language is not only crucial but necessary for survival when students want to improve their English skill oversea.

Secondly, for students who don't have basic English skills, it is recommended to study from scratch in the home country rather than learning abroad, as teachers who speak both languages can help students easier understand the differences between languages, such as grammar and vocabulary.

On the other hand, in regards to learning English, living in English-based countries provides plenty of opportunities that home countries don't have. English is not only about its grammar but also its culture. Experiencing different cultures firsthand through living with a native family as an exchange student is not comparable to just sitting in a class in the home country. In this way, not only will students' speaking and listening skills improve, but attention could be given to developing reading and writing as well.

Overall, a student's English level should be taken into consideration. A reasonable level of the language should be achieved in one's own country if a student lacks basic English skills. Otherwise, it is preferable to improve English in English-speaking countries.
