The following two pie charts compare the proportion of energy capacity in gigawatts in 2015 with the prediction for 2040. Overall, in 2040, it is predicted that renewable energy will increase by a large portion, whereas fossil fuels will be cut down significantly.

In 2015, the total energy capacity was 6.688 gigawatts. The dominant energy source was fossil fuels, which occupied 64 per cent of the energy sources. However, in the 2040 prediction, it will be reduced to 44 per cent despite the increase of total energy capacity raised to 11.678 gigawatts.

On the other hand, in 2015, renewable energy sources like wind, nuclear and solar took 5, 6 and 2 per cent, respectively. Nevertheless, the portion of these green energies is expected to be increased in large proportion, reportedly 12, 5 and 18 per cent for wind, nuclear and solar, respectively. Other renewables that used to be 23 per cent in 2015 will be lowered to 21 per cent slightly in 2040.

To sum up, it is expected that green energy will be the future of main power consumption. The prediction also indicates the trend in the near future.
