There are tons of reports about violence presence shown in schools or playgrounds and the profile frequency is only on the rise. Though reports show that responding with violence could hold back the growth of bullying, parents should really think of if teaching children to fight back with force would be a good example, considering the effect in the long run.

Many people believe that violence only breeds violence. Evidence has shown that children who grow up in violent families may become violent themselves when they grow up to be adults. Moreover, children may end up enjoying the power associated with violence and develop into bullies.

However, despite the fact that it may have a negative impact on children's personality development, in some occasions, fighting back could be the most efficient way to end bullying. In my opinion, this approach should be viewed as a last resort to put disputes to an end, as parents are supposed to play as a model to their children. Responding with force should be treated with caution.

Nevertheless, if children could learn that there are other ways of resolving disagreement, then it is possible when children grow up, they will behave similarly and know how to settle conflicts through discussion and compromise rather than force. This is a strong argument for encouraging a non-violent approach to the bullying issue.

In conclusion, in spite of there being circumstances when a violent response to bullying may be justified. It is my belief that teaching non-violent strategies is more efficient in the long run.
