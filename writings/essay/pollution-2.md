In most countries in the world, pollution is a concern for sure. Environments such as lands, water and air are all polluted to a certain degree. I believe the root cause can be pointed to the over-developed of our environment.

Firstly, in order to make room for different development purposes, many trees are cut down to fulfil the need, which, however, results in soil erosion. The land would become more loose and natural disasters such as landslides would occur more often than before. The other source of land pollution is the rubbish deposit. One of the usual ways to deal with trash is to bury them underground. Yet, some cannot perish easily due to the material used taking thousands of years to decompose.

The ways in which air is affected are as follows. By burning fossil fuels, we pump large amounts of toxic gases into the atmosphere which is not only harmful to the human body but also destructs the ozone layer. The emission of CO2 is considered the major reason that causes global warming, which leads to the risen of sea levels and unusual climate change.

The main effects of pollution on the water are the leak of detrimental chemicals into rivers and trash aggregation. The waste water dumped by factories contains chemical materials that lead to affecting animals' hormones or diseases. Floating trashes on the water is another issue that has been widely discussed. Sea creatures might mistake trashes and thus hurt themselves.

To fight against contamination, the following measures can be taken. Firstly, use only "biodegradable" materials which are decomposable by land. Secondly, to erase air pollution, we should change our transit policies to incentivise the use of public transport so that fewer fuels are consumed. Lastly, governments should impose taxes or fines on industries that repeatedly pollute our waterways.
