Vegetarian diets have become popular in recent years. Some people refuse to eat meat due to several arguments, such as health issues, environmental factors and religious concerns. Here I am going to discuss this and express my own opinion about it.

First of all, one of the factors that make people vegetarian is health concerns. Some people believe that eating meat could lead to a higher chance of getting diseases like high blood pressure or obesity. However, in my opinion, it doesn't prove that these diseases have high relation with eating meat. Some vegetarians have those mentioned diseases as well. Other materials like oil or sauce also determine whether one meal is healthy or not.

Besides health concerns, the reason why some choose to be vegetarian is the religion they believe in. A number of religions, such as Buddhism, for example, believe that it is wrong to kill a living being for its meat. Furthermore, different opinions on ethics also make some people against eating meat. They suggest that we should treat animals in a humane way, just like human rights. Without taking good care, keeping animals in pastures could result in ill animals.

Lastly, some statistics show that keeping animals produces more CO2 emissions than we could imagine. Since the environmental issue has always been a major topic, some believe that we should stop destructing forests for building pastures. Therefore, people stop eating meat as a way of protesting and nature protection.

To sum up, these ideas about health, the environment and the ethical treatment of animals have persuaded an increasing number of people to turn away from a meat-based diet. I understand those concerns, but except for the environmental problem, others are personal experiences or opinions. Unless another strong reason emerges, I wouldn't consider being a vegetarian.
