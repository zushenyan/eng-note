Homelessness is a crucial issue observed in many major cities, with an increasing number regardless of the place. There are many factors that could lead to this problem. Here I am going to examine possible causes and potential measures to resolve it.

The foremost factor that we should look into is economic status. Most people don't choose to live as homeless but without options. When an economic downturn happens, not only will it decrease the number of job opportunities, but also a loss of income. Insufficient funds and the poor situation of personal finance status lead to being unable to pay the cost of living, the rent being the top proportion of expense, especially. Therefore, the homeless are made.

The measures that should be taken into account are as follows. Firstly, since the root cause is the recession, governments should take approaches such as lowering the saving rate in order to incentivise entrepreneurs to apply for loans from banks. By doing this, job opportunities are facilitated, and thus more labours are employed. With the rising employment rate, the homeless problem should be mitigated.

On top of that, another way to rectify the situation is to improve social welfare. By allocating more resources and subsidising the minor, we should be able to see fewer homeless staying on the street. Perhaps, the ultimate solution might be just arranging houses for them. Reportedly, countries running the approach have drastically reduced the number of people without a home.

On the whole, homelessness is a serious concern for modern society for sure.   Governments should do their best to help every citizen to achieve happiness.
