Drugs are common medical use in modern societies, but in the meantime, we are also facing youths experimenting with both legal and illegal drugs. Children as young as ten years old are experimenting with alcohol and smoking. Although the reasons for this behaviour are unclear, some sociologists blame the examples set by the elders.

Parents who drink or smoke excessively are telling their children that it is acceptable to abuse their bodies with drugs. Eventually, children may share a similar point of view towards drug usage, even if their parents are against this. In addition, drug use shown in the media without a proper guide could confuse children that drug usage is wrong.

The other cause might be the pressure on the youth to perform well at school to compete with each other. Many don't want to live up to their parent's expectations, yet they haven't found a goal to pursue at that age. To be away from this hopelessness could be a temptation to experiment with drugs. Drugs are used as a means of expressing dissatisfaction with the pressure they face in society.

The effects of drug abuse are well known. For example, addiction to drugs can cost people's lives, and many young talents are wasted. Furthermore, people who drink and drink may be involved in fatal car accidents. The cost to society is huge, and enormous amounts of money are spent on convicting drug dealers and education programmes.

In conclusion, to solve this problem, the only way I would recommend is to educate people about the danger of drugs and to reduce the pressure of competition placed upon them.
