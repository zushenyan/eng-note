Whether natural talent plays a crucial role in one's success is a frequent discussion topic when people try to explain different levels of ability in fields, for example, music, sport or math. While some believe natural talent is the dominant factor that matters one's achievement in those domains, some argue that without systematic training from the education structure, one could not succeed. Both arguments stand their points. Here I am going to elaborate on this topic.

Obviously, the education system is based on the belief that all children can be taught effectively to acquire different skills, including those associated with music, sport or math. Based on our experience from school, we can find plenty of evidence that supports the point of view that one can learn a skill with continued teaching and guided practice.

On the other hand, some people think that innate talent is what differentiates average professionals from those who excel in their expertise. In other words, there is more to the skill than a learned technique, and this extra talent can never be taught. No matter how good a teacher is or how frequently a student practices.

Personally, I think that some talented people probably inherit via their genes. Such talents give individuals the advantage of learning various skills, while more hard-working students never manage to reach a comparable level. Nevertheless, as with all questions of nature versus nurture, they are not mutually exclusive. Exceptional musicians have succeeded through both training and talent. Without talent, continuous training would not be productive. Without training, students would not learn how to develop their innate gifts.

To sum up, I agree that any child can be taught particular skills, but to be excellent, some talents are required.
