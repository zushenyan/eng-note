Teleworking has become an integral part of our lives. With the existence of phones, laptops and the world-widely-covered Internet, people can start working in whichever place they want. However, while there are distinct advantages to this, it is important to guard against overuse and detrimental effects on various things.

One of the most obvious advantages is that employees are no longer bound to a place since every place can be the office. Moreover, the working hours can be more flexible, as workers can cope with business even if they are out of the office. It is particularly helpful for busy parents if daycare is not an option.

Another benefit is that the freedom of mobility enables firms to reach out and hire talents outside of where companies are, which leads to a deduction of expense and a higher chance of finding people who meet expectations. In fact, many businesses now only hire remote workers and thus to further reduce the cost of the rent and use this means to increase the number of potential candidates.

Despite the advantages mentioned above, care must be taken to ensure that remote work doesn't mean longer hours of work and less time spent on one's personal life, such as doing exercises or companying families. No one would deny that it is wonderful to work from anywhere, but spending too much time on a computer might be harmful to health in the long run.

On the whole, many people profit from the use of remote working, but we need to keep an eye on how much we rely on this type of work, or the disadvantages might outweigh the good parts.
