Globalization has been happening for decades around the globe. While we enjoy the benefit of globalization, some believe it hurts regional cultures and even destroys national identity. In this essay, I will elaborate on the pros and cons of globalization influences.

Firstly, it is the improvement of the economy. Through collaboration between nations, developed countries could export their techniques or expertise to developing nations in exchange for their labour at a lower expense. With relatively lower costs, commodities are sold globally at lower prices, which yields more margin. Developing countries also benefit from economic growth and possessing advanced skills. It's a win-win situation.

However, globalization is not only tradeÂ and tariffs between nations but also the blending between cultures. With globalization, western countries output their cultures to the rest of the world. The traditions in other places are slowly eaten up and even disappear. Younger generations will no longer recognize their heritage, which worsens the misunderstandings between ages. Communication between the young and the old will be tougher than before.

Lastly, it's the language. Since the advent of globalization, English is becoming a language spoken everywhere. A severe consequence that I could imagine is that it accelerates the dying pace of rarely used languages. With the rising popularity of English, it's only a matter of time before some languages become history.

In conclusion, though it is undeniable that globalization brings modern societies to a level of prosperity that has never been higher, locals are facing the challenge of culture dying out slowly. In my opinion, I agree with the statement. If we want to continue the benefit brought by globalization, those discussed issues are something we must take seriously.
