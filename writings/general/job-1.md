Dear John,

It's been a long time without seeing each other.

I am writing this letter to seek wisdom from you, hoping you could provide some meaningful advice.

I am planning to leave my current job, mainly because I don't satisfy with my compensation. I've asked my boss many times for a raise, but all his responce was - "we will see about that next year." Another reason is that I am growing tired of the content of my current job. It's becoming less challenging, and I hope to set out on a new journey to explore different areas.

As you may know, I have been a software engineer for six years. My current expertise is primarily system-level programming. However, I have been growing interested in web development recently. Since you have worked in this field for over five years, could you share advice on what kind of requirements I should fulfil to get this kind of job?

Thanks in advance, and I hope to hear from you soon!

Warm regards,

Andrew
