Dear John,

How have you been? We haven't met for a long time. I sincerely hope you are doing well recently.

It's very exciting to hear that you are moving to Taipei this summer. Congratulations on your new job!

If you ask me where is the best place to live in Taipei, I would say it is probably the Shinin district because of the vibrant vibe of the vicinity. You are access to a lot of leisure amenities. For example, there are tons of department stores, playgrounds, theatres and all the entertainment facilities you could imagine. Honestly, if it was the second-best place, I could not think of another place that could be the first.

In terms of transportation, we usually take MRT due to how super convenient it is. Normally, there is around 10 minutes interval between runs, and with the bus system, the transportation network could bring you literally any place you would like to go.

I would also like to introduce you to my friends. We can meet up at local pubs for a drink. Or, if you prefer outdoor activities, we can also take a casual route near the mountains for trekking.

Anyway, I can't wait to see you.

Regards,
Andrew
