Dear John,

I have recently found information about a conference which provides an onsite training course that might be useful. It is a conference about best practices in the software development industry. The training course will last for 3 days, from 10th Oct. to 13th Oct. During the session, I will be learning tools I can use to instrument the performance of an application in order to make it faster. It aligns with the goal for our next quarter, and thus it would be great if I could join this course.

I am writing this letter to ask for your support in taking part in this conference. I am sending a paid leave request, starting from 10/10 to 10/13. I will make sure I have done all related tasks in that timeframe, and I will take my computer with me in case of an emergency. Just let me know if you have any concerns.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,
Andrew
