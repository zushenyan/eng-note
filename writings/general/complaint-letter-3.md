Dear Sir,

I am writing in regard to the complaint I made to you last week during my stay at your hotel.

At the night on 25th October, I was staying at your hotel. The central heating system made a great deal of noise, which started at 3 am. The noise had been going on until we checked out. Not surprisingly, this resulted in a very poor night's sleep for me. I complained to you about the issue, and you assured me that you would contact me regarding the compensation. If I didn't mistake something, you mentioned that the hotel promised me a partial refund and some future discounts.

It has been two weeks since that conversation, and we have yet to hear from you. I would be grateful if you could send me a response and let me know when I can expect the detail concerning the compensation. 

Yours sincerely,

Andrew.
