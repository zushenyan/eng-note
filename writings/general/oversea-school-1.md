Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a new student at your school. Recently, I got admission to a two-year course in Advanced Computer Science Study at the end of November this year.

I am writing this letter to you because I would like to know more about the accommodation. Ideally, I would like to stay in a homestay, as I want to improve my English. If possible, it would be better if it is close to the College, so I don't have to spend a lot of time commuting. I heard one of my friends stayed in a homestay, and he had a great time and experienced different cultures. Hopefully, I could get the same experience as him.

In terms of dietary, I am a vegetarian, so it would be nice if you could arrange this for me. Though I have no opinion about children, preferably, I would like to stay with older people. Lastly, if there are different options regarding accommodation, please send them to me. In particular, I would like to know the price and location.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
Andrew Yan
