Dear Mr John,

Hi, I am Andrew Yan and I am a first-year student in your class at Taiwan college. I am writing this letter to you because I want to explain why I haven't finished the project that was supposed to be submitted last week.

I always love your class but unfortunately, as you may know, I have been absent for days with a heavy cold and I haven't been attending lectures. I went to a doctor. He prescribed some medicines and suggested I take a few days off before returning to school. I just felt better yesterday and started researching it. You will see from your records that I have never missed a deadline for any assignment so far during my course.

I am requesting an extension of one week to finish the assignment. Please take my illness into consideration and make this an exception.

Yours sincerely, 
Andrew Yan
