Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this complaint letter to express my dissatisfaction with the service I have received from your taxi driver company both during my ride and in dealing with my complaint.

Last Thursday, I took one of your taxis and was going to an important business meeting in the city. Although the driver said he knew the address, he took me to the wrong place. This made me late for my appointment. When I said it wasn't right and refused to pay the fare, he became angry and shouted at me. I put down his information and left the taxi, and I immediately wrote a complaint letter about it to your customer support. However, disappointedly, nobody answered and sent me a letter of apology for the driver's behaviour. As a representative of your company, he should behave in a courteous manner.

I would like to recommend that your company trains your staff to behave in a polite manner to customers. I also expect an apology for your employee's behaviour towards me, particularly the driver.

Yours sincerely,
Andrew Yan
