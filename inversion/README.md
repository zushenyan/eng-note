`*` the inversion comes in the second part of the sentence.

The following are not inversion because the adverb needs to modify the whole phrase, not the noun.
- `Hardly anyone passed the exam.`

# To Replace `if` with `had/were/should`
- `If I had been there, the problem wouldn't have happened.`
  - `Had I been there, the problem wouldn't have happened.`

# Move the adverbial expression of place at the beginning
- `All the money we had lost was on the table.`
  - `On the table was all the money we had lost.`
- `The knights came round the corner.`
  - `Round the corner came the knights.`

# `So + adj ... + that`
- `The girl was so beautiful that nobody could talk of anything else.`
  - `So beautiful was the girl that nobody could talk of anything else.`
- `The food was so delicious that we ate every last bite.`
  - `So delicious was the food that we ate every laste bite.`
